# Simple-Form-UI
Simple Form UI program (Flutter, Dart)

Features :
- Basic Form UI
- Responsive

Note :
-
In this case, I used id with auto-increment for the primary key. Therefore, the user doesn't need to fill in the primary key anymore.
To prevent the database from SQL Injection, I used bindValue() function.
This is a simple CRUD program, so feel free to customize the program.
